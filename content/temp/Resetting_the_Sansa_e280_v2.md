My SanDisk Sansa e280 v2 ran into a glitch recently. It just wouldn’t recharge the battery. The Sansa charges via a proprietary cable through the USB port. Having never experienced this issue before, I thought it was something wrong with the cable or with the USB ports on my computer. Well, after a bit of googling, I found the solution. Reset the device! So how do you reset the Sansa.

1.  Slide the HOLD switch atop the device to the right.
2.  Press and hold the Power / MENU button for 15 seconds.
3.  Press and hold the &lt;&lt; button, while plugging in the USB. Keep holding it till the Sansa says “Connected”.

This should cause Windows to pop up with the installing driver status message. Windows Explorer will now list two flash drives as devices with removable storage. Viola, Problem solved.

I upgraded the site to Drupal 7. The upgrade was smooth. I had to disable some modules that I used on the old site. I didn’t have much use of them, so might as well keep things simple.

Some things still need to be fixed. Like the error reporting and logging. I’ll get around to that eventually.

But for now, go Drupal!!

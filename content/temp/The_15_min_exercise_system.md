In a world of [Arnold Schwarzenegger]’s and [Sylvester Stallone]’s, people like Franz Kafka or J.P. Müller stand out. My take: Müller’s system combined with yoga and meditation might be the perfect exercise system. From the article: The exercise guide, which promised that just “15 minutes a day” of prescribed\* exercise would make “weaklings” into strong men (and women) \[…\] Müller wasn’t interested in building muscle mass through dumbbells.

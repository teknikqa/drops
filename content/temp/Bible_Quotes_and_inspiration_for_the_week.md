I was told two biblical passages before my interview this week.

Then I replied to them, “The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build”
- Nehemiah 2:20; <http://ref.ly/Ne2.20>

In your strength I can crush an army; with my God I can scale any wall.
- Psalm 18:29; <http://ref.ly/Ps18.29>

Its inspiring that there are people praying for me. People praying even without me asking them to pray. Its motivating and humbling to know that others think about and care for me. This might sound strange. But these people are ones with whom I last saw more than a year back. We have occasionally talked. But that’s about it. I have not told them that I was looking for a job. And yesterday, I get a mail that my old prayer fellowship is praying that I get a job soon.That is just amazing. (And it show the true Christian love).

This is why I’ve always believed that relationships are more important that any other worldly accomplishments. I would rather have wonderful friends and family and be happy, but poor than have all the riches in the world, but no one to share my joys with.

I pray that the Lord may guide me through the difficult paths of this life.

Oh, the interview went well. They didn’t ask many technical questions. Here’s one more verse to inspire for the week.

I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. - John 15:5; <http://ref.ly/Jn15.5>

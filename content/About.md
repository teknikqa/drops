Hi, I’m Nick Mathew, a web developer, computer security researcher, and music lover. I do a lot of work in PHP and Javascript, using [Drupal] as a framework. I have used other PHP frameworks too (like [Yii]). I have recently taken up node.js and Ruby for personal projects. I have past experience with Java and C, but haven’t used them in a long time. I use Linux (Fedora) as my operating system, but I’m content on any UNIX machine. I love tinkering with electronics and have customized almost all the stuff I own - laptops, smartphones, routers, cameras, xbox, satellite dishes. **Education** Masters degree from [SUNY Institute of Technology], Utica, New York (USA) Bachelors degree from [Cochin University Institute of Science & Technology] (India) My past academic research was about security of web applications. **Contact** You can contact me about work by email. Code on [Github] Professional network on [LinkedIn]. **Disclaimer** This is my personal blog. You will find thoughts, opinions, and nice findings on this blog.

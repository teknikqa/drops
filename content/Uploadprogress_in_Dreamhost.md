Uploadprogress is a useful php extension that displays the progress of a file upload.

Till recently I assumed that you couldn’t set it up under a shared hosting environment. I’m glad that I was wrong.

This comment in the Drupal forums gives step-by-step instructions on how to do it. ([PECL uploadprogress on shared hosting])

I’ll have to document the entire process for archival purposes. But some other time. For now its all there in that link.
